tock Data Dashboard Application â€“ Python, Taipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
Developed an interactive dashboard for analyzing and predicting S&P 500 stock trends using Python and the Taipy GUI framework. Integrated data filtering, visualization (Plotly), and machine learning models (Linear Regression, KNN, RNN with TensorFlow) to forecast stock prices. Built dynamic UI components for user-driven analysis by country, company, and date range, and implemented backend logic to support real-time updates and data processing.
## Introduction



## Requirements
- `taipy >= 4.0.0` (previous versions do no have `tp.Orchestrator()` but use `tp.Core()` instead)
- `plotly == 5.24.1`
- `tensorflow == 2.18.0`
- `scikit-learn == 1.5.2`

### Recommended Environment Setup - No GPU
```
>> conda create -n your_name python=3.11
>> conda activate your_name
>> pip install taipy
>> pip install plotly
>> pip install tensorflow
>> pip install scikit-learn
```

### Recommended Environment Setup - with GPU
This enviropnment will result in obtaining predictions faster. How faster depends on your CPU and GPU model.
<br>
On my end, it results in approx. 20% speed up from switching to RTX 4080 GPU over 12th Gen Intel i9-12900k CPU.

*Please replace the first command with one that <b>matches your system requirements and CUDA version</b> from <a href="https://docs.rapids.ai/install/" target="_blank">the official RAPIDS installation guide</a>. 
```
>> conda create -n your_name -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia cudf=24.10 python=3.12 'cuda-version>=12.0,<=12.5'
>> conda activate your_name
>> pip install taipy
>> pip install plotly
>> pip install tensorflow
>> pip install scikit-learn
```
